# Delivery-Boy-2D
We are a courier who delivers pizzas and our goal is to deliver all pizzas on time.

# Story
We play as a pizza courier. On a typical day, a pizza order is received and there are 100 pizzas in total. Our courier interprets this as normal and sets out to earn money.

# Game Explaniton
After making the delivery to the first building, something starts to go wrong. Dog noises and some other disgusting sounds are heard. This is where zombies start to spawn and wander around, trying to reach more places as time goes by. Our goal is to make all the deliveries before the time runs out.
